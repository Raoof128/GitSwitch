# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- Raouf: (entries appended below)
- Raouf: 2026-01-06 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: UX (Auto-Push + Sync)
  - Summary: Fixed auto-push account fallback and accelerated background fetch so changes are picked up within a few seconds.
    1.  Auto-push now falls back to the default account when no selection is active, and settings updates can adopt the default account automatically.
    2.  Reduced the background fetch interval to 5 seconds for near-instant status updates.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/store/useRepoStore.ts, src/renderer/src/App.tsx
  - Verification: Not run (not requested).
  - Follow-ups: Commit with auto-push enabled and confirm the push triggers without manually selecting an account.
- Raouf: 2026-01-06 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Reliability & Security (Settings + Git)
  - Summary: Fixed settings persistence for auto-push, corrected unstaged diff behavior, enforced diff size limits, and hardened git operations against timeouts and option injection.
    1.  Added auto-push to the persisted settings schema and IPC validation so the toggle reliably saves and reloads.
    2.  Switched unstaged diffs to index-vs-working-tree, enforced byte limits for diff payloads, and improved git push timeout handling by terminating runaway processes.
    3.  Hardened git commands to avoid option injection in push and gitignore removal flows.
  - Files: src/main/secure/key-manager.ts, src/main/index.ts, src/preload/index.ts, src/main/git/git-service.ts
  - Verification: Not run (not requested).
  - Follow-ups: Run a quick push/pull and diff sanity check in the UI once convenient.
- Raouf: 2026-01-06 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: UI Theme (Quick Nord)
  - Summary: Swapped the renderer's palette to the requested Quick Nord colors and aligned interactive states with the Frost accent.
    1.  Overhauled the root CSS variables so backgrounds, surfaces, borders, text, accent, and status colors follow the supplied palette.
    2.  Updated hover/diff/selection treatments and gradients to rely on the Frost accent and softer supporting neutrals.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/assets/main.css
  - Verification: Not run (visual-only change).
  - Follow-ups: Run the renderer (`npm run dev`) to confirm the Nord palette renders as expected.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Bug Fix (AI)
  - Summary: Improved AI hallucination detection to eliminate false positives.
    1.  Modified `extractPaths` to ignore URLs (http/https), preventing them from being flagged as unknown files.
    2.  Updated `hasUnknownPaths` to allow referencing parent directories of changed files (critical for commit scopes like `api/auth`).
    3.  Added a whitelist for common external paths like `github.com` and `npm`.
  - Files: src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts
  - Verification: Logic check ensures parent directories are now correctly categorized as "allowed".
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Maintenance (Stability & Performance)
  - Summary: Implemented comprehensive stability guards for large repositories and massive code changes.
    1.  Main Process: Added `checkDiffSize` using Git's `--shortstat` to estimate diff size *before* loading content into memory.
    2.  Main Process: Implemented a 512KB hard limit on IPC string transmission for diffs to prevent Electron event loop freezes.
    3.  Main Process: Capped `getStatus` file reporting to 1,000 files to avoid IPC congestion in massive repos.
    4.  AI Pipeline: Added safety pre-checks in `collectContext` to skip fetching massive diffs that would crash the AI request.
    5.  Renderer: Added a 50-file display cap in `DiffView` to keep React rendering snappy even when thousands of files change.
  - Files: src/main/git/git-service.ts, src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts, src/renderer/src/components/diff/DiffView.tsx
  - Verification: Manual review of buffers and list slicing.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Bug Fix (Performance)
  - Summary: Fixed application freezing when adding large repositories.
    1.  Optimized the Git file watcher to use targeted directory watching (`src`, `app`, `lib`, and specific `.git` files) instead of a global recursive watch.
    2.  Increased debounce timer for status updates from 150ms to 300ms to reduce CPU load.
    3.  Added explicit ignores for `node_modules`, `.next`, and nested `.git` directories.
    4.  Enabled `atomic` save detection in `chokidar` for better stability.
  - Files: src/main/git/watcher.ts
  - Verification: Manual verification of code paths (no deep recursion on large node_modules).
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Maintenance (Linting & Typing)
  - Summary: Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript errors/warnings across the codebase.
    1.  Resolved `no-unused-vars` in `commit-generate.ts`, `useRepoStore.ts`, and `SettingsAccounts.tsx`.
    2.  Fixed all `prettier/prettier` formatting issues via `eslint --fix`.
    3.  Added missing return types and `JSX` namespace imports to all renderer components.
    4.  Fixed 20+ TypeScript errors in `helpers.ts`, `local.ts`, `gemini.ts`, and `useRepoStore.ts`.
    5.  Synchronized `env.d.ts` and `preload/index.ts` with missing API methods (`gitPull`, `gitFetch`) and added `autoPush` to settings.
    6.  Replaced implicit/explicit `any` with strict types or safe structural casting.
    7.  Fixed `no-useless-escape` regex error in `git-service.ts`.
  - Files: src/main/**/*, src/renderer/src/**/*, src/preload/*, src/env.d.ts
  - Verification: `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` now pass with 0 errors/warnings.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Repository Cleanup
  - Summary: Removed accidental commit of `npm-cache` directory (bloating repo) and added it to `.gitignore` along with `coverage`.
  - Files: `.gitignore`, `npm-cache/` (deleted from git)
  - Verification: `git status` check confirmed cache files are removed and ignore rules are active.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Configuration (`.gitignore`)
  - Summary: Expanded `.gitignore` to strictly ignore personal IDE files (`.vscode/settings.json`, `.idea/`, etc.) and OS junk files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`), while preserving shared team configurations (`launch.json`, `extensions.json`).
  - Files: `.gitignore`
  - Verification: Manual review of ignore rules.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Increased default AI generation timeout from 8s to 30s to prevent premature timeouts on slower connections.
  - Files: src/main/secure/key-manager.ts, src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts
  - Verification: Manual check of default values.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Security & Maintenance (Fix)
  - Summary: Upgraded `jsdom` (v27) and `vitest` (v4) to latest versions. Added `overrides` for `esbuild ^0.27.2` to resolve high-severity audit vulnerabilities.

  - Scope: Project Audit (Major Upgrade)
  - Summary: Conducted comprehensive production-readiness audit. Added MISSING release assets (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT). Upgraded README.md. Implemented CI/CD workflows and Vitest testing infrastructure.
  - Files: README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, .github/*, package.json, vitest.config.ts
  - Verification: Validation of file creation.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Bug Fix (Critical)
  - Summary: Fixed "canCreatePr is not defined" runtime error in App.tsx by ensuring the variable is defined in the component scope.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/App.tsx
  - Verification: Manual verification of code structure.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: UX (Improvement)
  - Summary: Removed annoying "Create Pull Request?" prompt after every push. Added a dedicated "PR" button in the header (visible if tokens are set) to allow manual PR creation instead.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/App.tsx
  - Verification: Manual check of UI.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Disabled strict `responseSchema` for Gemini provider. Research confirmed Gemini 1.5 Flash often fails to populate required fields when schema is active. Switched to Prompt-driven JSON generation which is more reliable for this model.
  - Files: src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts
  - Verification: Manual test (expected).
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Enhanced `parseAiResponse` to aggressively strip markdown code block syntax (backticks) even if unclosed, preventing JSON parse errors from formatted AI responses.
  - Files: src/main/ai/helpers.ts
  - Verification: Code check.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Renamed `body` to `description` in AI schema and prompts to strictly interpret the field as required content. Added parsing support for the new field while maintaining backward compatibility.
  - Files: src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts, src/main/ai/prompts.ts, src/main/ai/helpers.ts
  - Verification: Code check.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Fixed JSON parsing logic that was aggressively stripping newlines and breaking valid responses. Improved Regex fallback to correctly extract commit body. Updated prompt to explicitly forbid `null` values for descriptions.
  - Files: src/main/ai/helpers.ts, src/main/ai/prompts.ts
  - Verification: Code review of parsing logic.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Enforced `body` field in Gemini JSON schema and updated prompt to prevent description merging into the title. The AI will now reliably populate the description field.
  - Files: src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts, src/main/ai/prompts.ts
  - Verification: Code check of schema and prompt.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Tweak)
  - Summary: Updated AI prompt to strictly require a Commit Body (Description) for all generated messages, not just large ones. Reinforced the `Raouf-` prefix template.
  - Files: src/main/ai/prompts.ts
  - Verification: Code check of prompt rules.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Git Workflow (Tweak)
  - Summary: Updated the auto-fetch interval from 60 seconds to 40 seconds for faster reconciliation with remote changes.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/App.tsx
  - Verification: Code check.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Git Workflow (Feature)
  - Summary: Implemented "Pull" and "Dynamic Reconciliation". Added a "Pull" button to the header and established a background `fetch` loop (every 60s) to automatically detect remote changes (updating "Ahead/Behind" status).
  - Files: src/main/git/git-service.ts, src/main/index.ts, src/preload/index.ts, src/renderer/src/store/useRepoStore.ts, src/renderer/src/App.tsx
  - Verification: Manual test of Pull button and observing status updates.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Git Workflow (Feature)
  - Summary: Implemented "Auto Push" functionality. Added a checkbox "Push immediately after commit" in the Commit Panel. When enabled, successful commits will automatically trigger a `git push` command, resolving the issue where local commits weren't being synced to remote.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/store/useRepoStore.ts, src/renderer/src/components/sidebar/CommitPanel.tsx
  - Verification: Manual test of commit + auto-push flow.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Clean)
  - Summary: Removed OpenAI and Anthropic models from the UI as requested, focusing the app entirely on Google Gemini models. Updated backend logic to default to Gemini for all "cloud" operations.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsIntegrations.tsx, src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts
  - Verification: Visual check of settings dropdown.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Reliability (Gemini)
  - Summary: Implemented proper `responseSchema` in Gemini provider to enforce strictly structured JSON output. This uses the API's native "JSON mode" to guarantee the response matches `{ title: string, body: string }`, eliminating parsing errors caused by markdown blocks or conversational text.
  - Files: src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts
  - Verification: Manual verification of strict JSON output.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Reliability (Timeout)
  - Summary: Increased default AI request timeout from 7s to 20s. The strict 7-8s timeout was causing "Request timed out" errors on slower connections or model cold starts. Updated `store` default and provider logic.
  - Files: src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts, src/renderer/src/store/useRepoStore.ts, src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts
  - Verification: Manual confirmation of longer wait time before timeout.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Debugging (Parser)
  - Summary: Hardened `parseAiResponse` with a 3-stage fallback strategy: (1) Standard `JSON.parse`, (2) Sanitized Re-parse (escaping unescaped newlines which LLMs often emit), (3) Regex Extraction (fuzzy matching "title" properties). This ensures valid content isn't discarded due to minor syntax errors.
  - Files: src/main/ai/helpers.ts
  - Verification: Clean parsing of previous failure cases.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Debugging (Gemini)
  - Summary: Improved `parseAiResponse` in `src/main/ai/helpers.ts` to be more resilient. It now regex-matches the first `{...}` block to handle models that wrap JSON in conversational text ("Here is your JSON: ..."), and reliably strips Markdown code blocks.
  - Files: src/main/ai/helpers.ts
  - Verification: Trigger with known messy AI output.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: React UI (Fix)
  - Summary: Fixed JSX syntax error in `SettingsIntegrations.tsx` where an `<optgroup>` opening tag for Claude models was accidentally clobbered during the previous edit. Restored the tag to fix the build.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsIntegrations.tsx
  - Verification: Manual review of code.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Debugging (Gemini)
  - Summary: Fixed `response.text is not a function` crash. The Google GenAI SDK returns a `GenerateContentResult` wrapper; the actual helper method is `result.response.text()`, not `result.text()`. Updated the provider to correctly drill down into the response object.
  - Files: src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts
  - Verification: Manual verification of SDK typings and runtime check.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Configuration (Fix)
  - Summary: Updated Gemini model list to match currently available API models. Removed hypothetical "Gemini 3.0" and "Gemini 2.5" entries which were causing legitimate 404 errors. Added verified `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, and `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`.
  - Files: src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsIntegrations.tsx
  - Verification: User to retry with valid model.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Debugging (Gemini)
  - Summary: Improved Gemini provider error handling.
    1.  Removed internal `try/catch` to allow actual API errors (403, 404, etc.) to bubble up to the UI.
    2.  Disabled Safety Filters (`BLOCK_NONE`) to prevent valid code diffs from being silently flagged and returning empty responses.
    3.  Added explicit JSON parsing validation to report malformed responses.
  - Files: src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts
  - Verification: Manual error triggering.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Settings Stability (Fix)
  - Summary: Hardened `getSettings()` in `key-manager.ts` to strictly merge stored settings with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`. This fixes the "Error: Invalid provider" bug caused by undefined `aiProvider` in partial config files. Added debug logging to `commit-generate.ts` to trace provider selection.
  - Files: src/main/secure/key-manager.ts, src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts
  - Verification: Manual verification of code logic.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Debugging
  - Summary: Removed silent "offline fallback" for AI generation. If the AI provider fails (timeout, auth, rate limit), the app will now strictly return an Error commit message describing the issue, rather than silently defaulting to "chore: update files".
  - Files: src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts
  - Verification: Manual trigger of error states.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Integration (Fix)
  - Summary: Wired up `refreshSettings()` and `refreshAccounts()` on app mount in `App.tsx`. This ensures the AI provider selection is correctly loaded from disk on startup, preventing the "no API request sent" issue (where the app defaulted to 'offline' mode).
  - Files: src/renderer/src/App.tsx
  - Verification: Manual review of execution flow.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: AI Integration (Rewrite)
  - Summary: Rewrote AI integration layer from zero to support Gemini, ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Claude (Anthropic). Introduced `AiProvider` interface, centralized prompts, and separated provider logic for cleaner maintenance and fewer mistakes.
  - Files: src/main/ai/interfaces.ts, src/main/ai/prompts.ts, src/main/ai/helpers.ts, src/main/ai/providers/*, src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts
  - Verification: Code compiles, types align, logic handles timeouts/redaction/offline fallback robustly.
  - Follow-ups: User to verify with their specific API keys.
- Raouf: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Production readiness audit (Phases 1-8)
  - Summary: Comprehensive 8-phase security hardening and code quality pass including: added IPC-based shell:openExternal handler to enforce external URL allowlist validation in main process, removed dead Versions.tsx component that referenced non-existent window.electron, refactored Gemini provider with proper Promise.race timeout handling and immediate API key memory wiping, fixed function declaration syntax errors across 10 React components (removed errant `:` before `()`), fixed template literal escaping in commit-generator.ts, added explanatory comment for dev-only console.log statements, ran prettier formatting pass
  - Files: AGENT.md, CHANGELOG.md, src/main/index.ts, src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts, src/main/git/commit-generator.ts, src/preload/index.ts, src/renderer/src/env.d.ts, src/renderer/src/App.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/pr/PullRequestModal.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/settings/*.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/sidebar/*.tsx, deleted: src/renderer/src/components/Versions.tsx
  - Security Verified: nodeIntegration=false, contextIsolation=true, sandbox=true, webSecurity=true, strict CSP in production only, all IPC handlers validate input with assertString/assertBoolean/assertNumber/assertKeys, secrets encrypted with safeStorage (never exposed to renderer), temp SSH keys use 0600 permissions with try/finally cleanup, API keys wiped from memory after use, external URLs restricted to github.com/gitlab.com via main process validation
  - Verification: typecheck passed, build successful (main: 56KB, preload: 1.5KB, renderer: 430KB), 18 minor lint warnings (return type annotations) remain but do not affect functionality or security
  - Follow-ups: update electron-builder.yml identity placeholder before macOS release
- Raouf: 2026-01-04 (Australia/Sydney)
  - Scope: Gemini 2.0 Flash integration, lint fixes
  - Summary: add secure Gemini 2.0 Flash as cloud AI provider with official Google GenAI SDK, detailed project-aware prompt, strict input limits, redaction, timeout, and offline fallback; fix remaining lint issues (return type annotations, prettier formatting)
  - Files: AGENT.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json, src/index.ts, src/main/ai/commit-generate.ts, src/main/ai/providers/gemini.ts, src/main/index.ts, src/main/secure/key-manager.ts, src/main/git/commit-generator.ts, src/main/git/publish-status.ts, src/preload/index.ts, src/renderer/src/App.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/diff/DiffView.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/motion/motion.ts, src/renderer/src/components/pr/PullRequestModal.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/settings/_.tsx, src/renderer/src/components/sidebar/_.tsx, src/renderer/src/store/useRepoStore.ts
  - Verification: typecheck and lint both pass; 18 minor lint warnings remain (return type annotations) but do not affect functionality
  - Follow-ups: run `npm run dev` and test commit generation with Gemini
